This repo houses the (very simple) public website for DuoBit.

# Running locally

The site is simple enough to serve up from a `file://` path, but if you want to run it behind a webserver, fire up the included docker file with `docker-compose up --build` and browse at http://localhost:8080. Docker pre-reqs are an exercise for the reader.
